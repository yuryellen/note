 the construction site, Mr. Lee was checking angles with his protractor when he noticed:

1. The roof frame formed a perfect **triangle** structure.
2. One section was an **oblique triangle** with no right angles.
3. "This **right angle** corner needs adjustment," he said, holding up his square.
4. The windows were all **rectangle**-shaped for classic style.
5. The tiles came in **square** packages for easy stacking.
6. "We need more **circle**-shaped pipes for the plumbing," he told his assistant.
7. Suddenly, the ladder became **oblique** in the strong wind!

After fixing everything, Mr. Lee smiled. "Geometry helps us build safely and beautifully," he said, packing his tools at a perfect right angle.erfect right angle.
