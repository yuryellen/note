Good afternoon, professors. I have a great honor to attend this interview.

下午好，教授们。我很荣幸能参加这次面试。

My name is [Your Name], and I graduated from Shandong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Materials Science.

我叫[你的名字]，毕业于山东科技大学材料科学专业。

During my undergraduate studies, I built a solid foundation in fundamental courses such as Materials Science, Inorganic Chemistry, and Solid State Theory. I also participated in several laboratory projects, where I learned to use material characterization techniques and analyze experimental data. These experiences helped me develop a strong interest in microelectronics and nanomaterials, especially in how materials’ microscopic structures determine their macroscopic properties.

在本科学习期间，我在材料科学、无机化学和固态理论等基础课程上打下了坚实的基础。我还参加了几个实验室项目，在那里我学会了使用材料表征技术和分析实验数据。这些经历帮助我对微电子和纳米材料产生了浓厚的兴趣，特别是在材料的微观结构如何决定其宏观性质方面。

I’m a hardworking and curious learner who enjoys both teamwork and independent research. I value precision, patience, and creativity in scientific exploration.

In the future, I hope to further my study in advanced materials and semiconductor-related research, mastering modern characterization methods and computational techniques. I believe that your graduate program, with its excellent faculty and research resources, will provide me with the ideal environment to achieve my academic and professional goals.

我是一个勤奋和好奇的学习者，喜欢团队合作和独立研究。我重视科学探索中的精确性、耐心和创造力。
未来，我希望进一步学习先进材料和半导体相关研究，掌握现代表征方法和计算技术。我相信，你们的研究生课程及其优秀的师资和研究资源将为我实现学术和职业目标提供理想的环境。

Thank you very much for your time. I sincerely hope for the opportunity to continue my academic journey in your program.
。

非常感谢您抽出时间。我真诚地希望有机会在你们的项目中继续我的学术之旅。
