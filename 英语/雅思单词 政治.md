In the ancient kingdom¹ of Avalon, where the realm² was ruled by a strict regime³, the Senate⁴ and the Congress⁵ often fought fiercely. Political partisan⁶ disputes were endless, and though diplomacy⁷ tried to calm the storms, the league⁸ of nobles and their confederates⁹ held too much power. Some small towns wished to affiliate¹⁰ with Avalon, but their unconventional¹¹ traditions were seen as dangerous by the dictatorial¹² king, who ruled with an authoritative¹³ voice and surrounded himself with influential¹⁴ advisers.

在古老的阿瓦隆王国¹里，这片领域²由一个严格的政权³统治。参议院⁴和国会⁵经常激烈争斗。党派⁶的争端无休无止，尽管外交⁷试图平息风暴，但贵族的联盟⁸和同盟者⁹掌握了过多权力。一些小镇希望隶属¹⁰阿瓦隆，但他们非传统¹¹的习俗被专制的¹²国王视为危险。国王以权威¹³的声音统治，身边环绕着有影响力的¹⁴顾问。

Power was highly centralised¹⁵, and the authority¹⁶ of the king was treated as a privilege¹⁷. But whispers of democracy¹⁸ rose among the people, who demanded recognition of their nationality¹⁹. In faraway lands, other kingdoms²⁰ and realms²¹ were also in turmoil, as new sovereignties²² emerged and claimed autonomy²³. To maintain order, commissions²⁴ and committees²⁵ were formed, preparing for the great elections²⁶, where every ballot²⁷ represented an ideology²⁸.

权力被高度集中¹⁵，国王的权威¹⁶被当作特权¹⁷。但人民中出现了民主¹⁸的呼声，他们要求承认自己的国籍¹⁹。在遥远的土地上，其他王国²⁰和领域²¹也陷入混乱，因为新的主权²²力量出现并要求自治²³。为维持秩序，设立了委员会²⁴²⁵，筹备盛大的选举²⁶，每一张选票²⁷都承载着一种意识形态²⁸。

Public parades²⁹ became common, where leaders would govern³⁰ not only by decree but also through open debate. They would confer³¹ in secret, entitling³² citizens with new rights, though some rulers still sought to exploit³³ them. A great reformation³⁴ began: people chose to emigrate³⁵, and each emigrant³⁶ carried stories of freedom. Others would immigrate³⁷ into Avalon's lands, and every immigrant³⁸ was carefully inspected³⁹. Yet darker times came when invaders tried to enslave⁴⁰ entire villages, and their enslavement⁴¹ brought suffering. Soldiers would hustle⁴² crowds, impelled⁴³ by cruel orders.

公众的游行²⁹变得常见，领袖们不只是通过法令治理³⁰，也通过公开辩论。他们会秘密协商³¹，赋予³²公民新的权利，尽管有些统治者仍想剥削³³他们。一场伟大的改革³⁴开始了：人们选择移居³⁵，他乡的移民³⁶带着自由的故事离开。也有人移入³⁷阿瓦隆的土地，每位移民³⁸都被仔细视察³⁹。但更黑暗的时刻到来了，入侵者企图奴役⁴⁰整个村庄，他们的奴役⁴¹带来痛苦。士兵驱赶⁴²人群，被残酷的命令驱使⁴³。

Some turned to anarchism⁴⁴, rejecting both republican⁴⁵ ideals and monarchy⁴⁶. Colonies were built as settlers sought to colonise⁴⁷ new lands, demanding an amendment⁴⁸ to the law. Yet dissenters were often deported⁴⁹, while kings continued to reign⁵⁰ in tyrannical⁵¹ ways, sending ultimatums⁵² to rebels. This domination⁵³ led one ruler to abdicate⁵⁴, while others chose to administer⁵⁵ through gentle administration⁵⁶. New schools were instituted⁵⁷, welfare⁵⁸ improved, and citizens could vote⁵⁹ freely. Workers, however, launched strikes⁶⁰, breaking old taboos⁶¹ about obedience.

Religion, too, shaped Avalon's destiny. Buddhism⁶², Taoism⁶³, Christianity⁶⁴, and Islam⁶⁵ all competed for influence, each offering a different creed⁶⁶. Some believed they were doomed⁶⁷, their lives already destined⁶⁸ by destiny⁶⁹ itself. Others embraced fatalism⁷⁰, while priests blessed⁷¹ the people with holy words and chanted invocations⁷². The most devout⁷³ citizens joined cults⁷⁴, while monks would consecrate⁷⁵ their lives to the gods.

宗教也塑造了阿瓦隆的命运。佛教⁶²、道教⁶³、基督教⁶⁴和伊斯兰教⁶⁵都在争夺影响力，各自提供不同的信条⁶⁶。有些人认为自己注定⁶⁷⁶⁸⁶⁹，另一些人信奉宿命论⁷⁰，而祭司们用圣言祝福⁷¹人民，吟诵祈祷⁷²。最虔诚⁷³的信徒加入崇拜⁷⁴，而僧侣们把生命奉献⁷⁵给神明。

At the same time, Avalon's cultural life flourished. Artists worked on bold designs⁷⁶, shaping Avalon's profile⁷⁷ into an aesthetic⁷⁸ wonder. People enjoyed crosstalk⁷⁹, played chess⁸⁰, and went hiking⁸¹. Some preferred hitch-hiking⁸² across mountains, or surfing⁸³ on distant seas.

Noble families visited art galleries⁸⁸, lovers strolled through every scenery spot⁸⁹, and pilgrims sought mineral baths⁹⁰ for peace. Children laughed in pleasure grounds⁹¹ and amusement parks⁹².
