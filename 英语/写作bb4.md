- In morden sociaty， the hunting of wildlife is prevalent. publich claim that money and time should be spent on protection of the animal and plant species. However, another group of people argue that issues about human population should be paid more attention.(they should pay more attention to the attention to issues about human populations). I think these two point of views deserve discussion.

It is undenied that the deflection of human protection of animals has so many benefits. The government should invest more money in setting up wild reserve conservation of the animals, which can reduce extinction of the spieces of animals. These fund in animal conservation can not only help to protect the habitats of the animal,but also develop the tourism of that place, which is beneficial for the economy of the local area.

However, there are also some issues for public themselves need to be considered. Firstly, ageing population require is also imprtant.  It needs the government to fund in health care. Secondly, human's base requirments should be priority consideration. There are a large amount of people who is poverty. Help them through education and training by the government fund of these stuff should be holded in a important position. What's more, food security should also be considered. The government should invest more money in developing the food system to ensure it is safely for the public.
