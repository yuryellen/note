The Secret Alchemy of the Earth

In the ancient world, chemistry¹ was often mixed with alchemy², where dreamers sought to turn lead³ into gold. Though such attempts were hackneyed⁴, their minds opened paths to new ideas. They discovered that a caustic⁵ liquid could erode⁶ stone, that food could become stale⁷ and finally rot⁸, leaving behind a rotten⁹ smell. They also learned that metals would corrode¹⁰, just as fire devours wood.

在古代，化学¹常常和炼金术²混在一起，梦想家们想要把铅³变成黄金。尽管这种尝试很陈腐⁴，但他们的思想却开辟了新的道路。他们发现腐蚀性的⁵液体能腐蚀⁶石头，食物会变陈⁷，最终腐烂⁸，留下腐烂的⁹气味。他们还知道金属会腐蚀¹⁰，就像火焰吞噬木头。

As centuries passed, humans learned to use gasoline¹¹, silica¹², and petroleum¹³. They found hydrocarbons¹⁴ like methane¹⁵, born from decomposition¹⁶ of plants trapped in limestone¹⁷ layers. The earth itself acted as an intermediary¹⁸, where heat and pressure were a hidden catalyst¹⁹. In the furnaces, flames would scorch²⁰ surfaces, leaving a dark tint²¹. Later, with hydronic²² systems, humans tamed fire into warmth. They crafted artificial²³ fertilizers, studied the molecule²⁴, and dissolved salts in solution²⁵, filtering out impurities²⁶ from each compound²⁷.

随着世纪流转，人类学会了使用汽油¹¹、硅土¹²和石油¹³。他们发现碳氢化合物¹⁴，比如甲烷¹⁵，源自植物在石灰石¹⁷层中的分解¹⁶。大地本身就像是一个媒介物¹⁸，高温与压力成了隐藏的催化剂¹⁹。在火炉里，火焰会烧焦²⁰表面，留下暗色的痕迹²¹。后来，借助液体循环²²系统，人类将火化为温暖。他们制造人造²³肥料，研究分子²⁴，把盐溶解在溶液²⁵中，从混合物²⁷里滤出杂质²⁶。

They explored metals: sodium²⁸, zinc²⁹, helium³⁰, ammonia³¹, iodine³², oxygen³³, tin³⁴, calcium³⁵, silicon³⁶, sulfur³⁷, nitrogen³⁸, silver³⁹, nickel⁴⁰, lead⁴¹, copper⁴², and even platinum⁴³. Each was functional⁴⁴ in some way. Acid and base could neutralise⁴⁵ each other in an action⁴⁶ that could sear⁴⁷ skin. The burning⁴⁸ of coal caused blasts⁴⁹ that shattered rocks into tiny particles⁵⁰, releasing strange substances⁵¹. Some were explosive⁵², ready to explode⁵³ at a spark, to kindle⁵⁴ and ignite⁵⁵ flames.

他们研究金属：钠²⁸、锌²⁹、氦³⁰、氨³¹、碘³²、氧³³、锡³⁴、钙³⁵、硅³⁶、硫³⁷、氮³⁸、银³⁹、镍⁴⁰、铅⁴¹、铜⁴²，甚至铂⁴³。每一种都有其作用⁴⁴。酸与碱能彼此中和⁴⁵，这种作用⁴⁶能灼烧⁴⁷皮肤。煤炭的燃烧⁴⁸引发爆破⁴⁹，把岩石打碎成细小颗粒⁵⁰，释放出奇异的物质⁵¹。有些极具爆炸性⁵²，一点火花就能爆炸⁵³，燃起⁵⁴并点燃⁵⁵烈火。

Through combination⁵⁶, metals formed alloys; through polymerisation⁵⁷, plastics were born. With catalysis⁵⁸, reactions sped up. Glue became adhesive⁵⁹, while cloths turned white with bleach⁶⁰ or bright with dye⁶¹. From the marriage of biology and chemistry came biochemistry⁶², the alchemy of life. At the heart of reactions, each ion⁶³ floated, its solubility⁶⁴ defining the role of the solvent⁶⁵. Every discovery unveiled a new element⁶⁶, or a strange blend⁶⁷ of matter.

通过化合⁵⁶，金属形成合金；通过聚合⁵⁷，塑料诞生。在催化作用⁵⁸下，反应加速。胶水成为黏合剂⁵⁹，布料因漂白剂⁶⁰而洁白，因染料⁶¹而鲜亮。生物与化学结合，生物化学⁶²由此而生，成了生命的炼金术。反应的核心，是漂浮的离子⁶³，它的溶解性⁶⁴决定了溶剂⁶⁵的作用。每一项发现都揭示了新的元素⁶⁶，或者奇异的混合物⁶⁷。

Deep in the earth, veins⁶⁸ of metal waited in dark pits⁶⁹ and deep boreholes⁷⁰. They mined quartz⁷¹, carved marble⁷², and polished each gem⁷³. Builders stacked fieldstones⁷⁴, jewelers carved emeralds⁷⁵, sculptors shaped granite⁷⁶, and volcanoes poured lava⁷⁷ that trapped rubies⁷⁸. Sometimes, explorers found a bonanza⁷⁹, a wealth of minerals⁸⁰ and ores⁸¹. Even aluminum⁸², so light yet strong, was drawn from the stone. Behind all lay the molecule⁸³, ruled by nuclear⁸⁴ power at its core.

在大地深处，矿脉⁶⁸沉睡在黑暗的矿坑⁶⁹和深邃的钻孔⁷⁰里。他们开采石英⁷¹，雕刻大理石⁷²，打磨宝石⁷³。建造者堆叠散石⁷⁴，珠宝匠雕刻祖母绿⁷⁵，雕刻家塑造花岗岩⁷⁶，火山喷涌熔岩⁷⁷，封存红宝石⁷⁸。有时探险者会找到富矿带⁷⁹，满是矿物⁸⁰与矿石⁸¹。甚至铝⁸²，这样轻而坚固的金属，也从石头中提炼。其背后的一切，都归结于分子⁸³，而其核心，受核能⁸⁴所支配。



The Secret Alchemy of the Earth

In the ancient world, chemistry¹(化学) was often mixed with alchemy²(炼金术), where dreamers sought to turn lead³(铅) into gold. Though such attempts were hackneyed⁴(陈腐的), their minds opened paths to new ideas. They discovered that a caustic⁵(腐蚀性的) liquid could erode⁶(腐蚀) stone, that food could become stale⁷(陈腐的) and finally rot⁸(腐烂), leaving behind a rotten⁹(腐烂的) smell. They also learned that metals would corrode¹⁰(腐蚀), just as fire devours wood.

As centuries passed, humans learned to use gasoline¹¹(汽油), silica¹²(硅土), and petroleum¹³(石油). They found hydrocarbons¹⁴(碳氢化合物) like methane¹⁵(甲烷/沼气), born from decomposition¹⁶(分解/腐烂) of plants trapped in limestone¹⁷(石灰石) layers. The earth itself acted as an intermediary¹⁸(媒介物), where heat and pressure were a hidden catalyst¹⁹(催化剂). In the furnaces, flames would scorch²⁰(烧焦/灼烧) surfaces, leaving a dark tint²¹(染色/色调). Later, with hydronic²²(液体循环的) systems, humans tamed fire into warmth. They crafted artificial²³(人造的/假的) fertilizers, studied the molecule²⁴(分子), and dissolved salts in solution²⁵(溶液), filtering out impurities²⁶(杂质) from each compound²⁷(化合物).

Each was functional⁴⁴(起作用的) in some way. Acid and base could neutralise⁴⁵(中和) each other in an action⁴⁶(作用) that could sear⁴⁷(烧灼) skin. The burning⁴⁸(燃烧的) of coal caused blasts⁴⁹(爆破) that shattered rocks into tiny particles⁵⁰(颗粒), releasing strange substances⁵¹(物质).

From the marriage of biology and chemistry came biochemistry⁶²(生物化学), the alchemy of life. At the heart of reactions, each ion⁶³(离子) floated, its solubility⁶⁴(溶解性) defining the role of the solvent⁶⁵(溶剂/可溶解的). Every discovery unveiled a new element⁶⁶(元素), or a strange blend⁶⁷(混合/混合物) of matter.

Deep in the earth, veins⁶⁸(矿脉) of metal waited in dark pits⁶⁹(矿坑/坑) and deep boreholes⁷⁰(钻孔). They mined quartz⁷¹(石英), carved marble⁷²(大理石), and polished each gem⁷³(宝石). Builders stacked fieldstones⁷⁴(散石/大卵石), jewelers carved emeralds⁷⁵(祖母绿/翡翠), sculptors shaped granite⁷⁶(花岗岩), and volcanoes poured lava⁷⁷(熔岩) that trapped rubies⁷⁸(红宝石). Sometimes, explorers found a bonanza⁷⁹(富矿带), a wealth of minerals⁸⁰(矿物) and ores⁸¹(矿石). Even aluminum⁸²(铝), so light yet strong, was drawn from the stone.
