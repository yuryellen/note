🌷A Day of Work and Connection

（工作与交流的一天）

🕰️Part 1 — Leisure and Communication

It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, and I finally had some leisure time¹.
I wandered along the street and stopped by a small telephone booth².

Inside, there was an old pay phone⁴, still shining faintly under the sunlight.
It reminded me of the days when people used to call on sb.⁵ just to chat,
to keep contact⁹ with friends who lived far away.

那是一个安静的星期天下午，我终于有了些闲暇时间。
我在街上漫步，停在一个小小的公用电话亭前。
里面的投币式公用电话在阳光下还微微发亮。
它让我想起那些人们互相拜访、保持联系的日子。

Suddenly, the phone rang—it startled me a little.
I picked it up and heard a familiar voice—it was an old friend asking me for a date³.

I laughed softly and said, “Hold on¹⁰, I’ll take my coat.”
We talked for a while, promised to meet, and I gently hung up⁸ the receiver.

🩵翻译：
突然，电话响了——我被吓了一跳。
我接起电话，听见熟悉的声音——是老朋友在邀请我约会。
我轻轻笑着说：“别挂电话，我去拿外套。”
我们聊了几句，约好见面后，我轻轻地挂上电话。

Later that afternoon, I met her in a cozy café.
She was cheerful and hospitable¹¹, just like she used to be.
Talking with her felt like time had never passed.

🩵翻译：
那天下午晚些时候，我在一家温馨的咖啡馆见到了她。
她依旧那么开朗、好客，
与她交谈的感觉，就像时间从未流逝。

💼Part 2 — Job Hunting

The next morning, life returned to its rhythm.
I started job hunting¹² seriously.

There were so many want ads⁴ online,
but most companies required experience, and I was still inexperienced².
Even so, I believed every opportunity³ could be a new beginning.

🩵翻译：
第二天早晨，生活又回到了原本的节奏。
我开始认真地找工作。
网上有很多招聘广告，
但大多数公司都要求经验，而我还没有经验。
即便如此，我仍然相信每个机会都是新的开始。

I spent the whole afternoon preparing my resume¹⁴
and writing a thoughtful application letter¹⁵.

I also consult¹³ed a company about an opening/vacancy⁸,
hoping they might give me a chance for an interview¹⁹.

🩵翻译：
我花了一整个下午准备简历，
并认真写下了一封求职信。
我还咨询了一家公司关于他们的职位空缺，
希望能获得一次面试机会。

When the day came, the interviewer²³ looked serious,
while I, the interviewee²¹, tried to stay confident²⁶
and leave a good impression²⁵.

But later, I heard that they had turned me down²⁷.
I sighed, but smiled—job-hopping²⁰ is normal,
and maybe the next position⁶ would be a better match.

🩵翻译：
到了那天，面试官神情严肃，
而我，作为面试者，努力保持自信，
留下一个好的印象。
可后来我得知，他们拒绝了我。
我叹了口气，却仍然微笑——跳槽很常见，
或许下一个职位才真正适合我。

🧳Part 3 — Working and Traveling

Months passed, and I finally got a full-time job⁹.
Soon after, my boss sent me on business¹ to another city.

There, I was in charge of⁴ a small branch¹⁰,
managing transactions¹² and cooperation¹¹ with our clients⁵.

🩵翻译：
几个月过去了，我终于找到了一份全职工作。
不久，老板派我出差到另一座城市。
在那里，我负责一个小型分支机构，
处理与客户的交易与合作。

Sometimes, we had to make a compromise⁶ to complete a proposal⁸,
but everyone tried to get along with⁷ one another.

One day, our company won a bid¹³,
and I received an appointment²⁴ to take over²² a new department.

🩵翻译：
有时我们为了完成建议书不得不妥协，
但大家都尽力与彼此相处。
有一天，公司赢得了一个投标，
我也收到了任命，要接管一个新部门。

I thanked my colleagues for their assistance⁹ and support.
From doing odd jobs¹² to becoming a manager,
life felt like a long transfer¹⁴—
sometimes tiring, but always full of hope.

🩵翻译：
我感谢同事们的帮助与支持。
从做零工到成为经理，
人生就像一次漫长的调动——
虽然有时疲惫，却总是充满希望。
