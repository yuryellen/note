🌙 Work, Passion, and a Taste of Life

In the modern world, a good attitude¹ and strong personality² matter as much as skills. Tom is a diligent⁶ young man, always determined⁴ to do his best. Sometimes he has to overwork³, but even when he feels worn out⁷, he never gives up. His secret is perseverance⁸—he knows how to hang on⁹ even when the workload¹¹ is heavy. People call him a workaholic¹⁰, but he simply smiles and says, “I’m just hard-working¹⁴, not forgetful⁵ of my dreams.” His struggle¹² is full of continuous exploration¹³ and quiet courage.

在现代社会中，良好的态度和坚强的性格与技能同样重要。汤姆是个勤奋的年轻人，总是有决心做到最好。即使不得不加班、感到疲惫，他也不会放弃。他的秘诀是坚持不懈——即使工作负担很重，他也懂得如何坚持。人们称他为工作狂，但他微笑着说：“我只是工作努力，从不健忘我的梦想。”他的奋斗充满了不断探索与无声的勇气。

Because of his hard work, Tom soon gained recognition¹⁵ and even a tribute¹⁶ from his company. His achievement¹⁷ made him a pioneer¹⁸ among young employees. Everyone admired his contribution¹⁹, and his ability to blaze a trail²⁰ became a symbol²¹ of the company’s spirit. Some even called him a legend²², but Tom just laughed. “A true hero,” he said, “knows when to rest.”

由于他的努力，汤姆很快获得了公司的认可，甚至得到一份特别的致敬。他的成就让他成为年轻员工中的先驱。大家都赞赏他的贡献，而他开拓的精神成为公司文化的象征。有些人甚至称他为传奇，但汤姆只是笑笑说：“真正的英雄，也要懂得休息。”

So, on weekends, Tom loves the entertainment industry¹³ as much as his work. Sometimes he watches a documentary¹⁰, sometimes a horror movie⁷ or a violence movie¹¹ on different TV channels⁶. When he feels poetic, he listens to a broadcast⁸ or enjoys a live broadcast⁹ from his favorite band. On sunny days, he does gardening³ or goes on an excursion⁴ with friends. Life, after all, is more than deadlines—it’s a performance⁵ of joy and balance.

因此在周末，汤姆同样热爱娱乐行业。有时他会看纪录片、恐怖片或暴力片，切换不同的电视频道。当他有诗意的时候，会听广播节目或欣赏乐队的现场直播。阳光明媚的日子里，他喜欢做园艺，或和朋友一起短途旅行。毕竟，生活不仅仅是截止日期，它更是一场充满快乐与平衡的表演。

After work, he often goes out for dinner with friends. A waiter/waitress¹⁴ greets them kindly as they look through the menu⁴. Sometimes they order beef steak³ or pork², choosing between raw⁵, medium⁶, or done⁷. Then comes the appetizer¹¹, maybe a loaf¹⁴ of bread or a sweet dessert⁸. They might eat buffet¹⁵ style or enjoy a regular dinner¹⁸. “Let’s go dutch¹⁷,” someone says, and Tom laughs while counting his change²⁰. Life feels simple and warm.

下班后，他常和朋友外出就餐。服务员微笑着迎接他们，他们翻看着菜单。有时点牛排或猪肉，选择生的、半熟的或全熟的。接着上开胃菜，可能是一块长条面包或甜美的甜点。他们也许选择自助餐或套餐。有人说：“我们AA制吧”，汤姆笑着数着零钱。生活就这样，简单而温暖。

When he makes a reservation¹² for dinner, he feels grateful. “Life isn’t about being first,” he thinks, “but about having the courage to live fully.” Work, rest, and dreams blend together like flavors in a beverage²—each taste reminding him that balance is the truest success.

每当他为晚餐预订时，他心中总是充满感激。“生活不是为了争第一，”他想，“而是要有勇气去认真地活着。”工作、休息与梦想，就像一杯混合的饮料那样交织在一起——每一种味道，都提醒他：平衡，才是最真实的成功。
