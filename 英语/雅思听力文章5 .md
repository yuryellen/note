🌿 A Journey Through Illness and Recovery

When the epidemic¹ spread through the city, I had just planned a trip with my friends through a travel agency². I had been feeling a bit tired, but I thought it was only a sore throat³ from the cold air. We checked our flight number⁴ and went to the airport early to check in⁵. Everything felt exciting — a new place, a motel⁶ waiting for us, and freedom on the road.

当流行病¹在城市里蔓延时，我正好通过旅行社²计划了一次旅行。我觉得有点累，以为只是吹风导致的嗓子疼³。我们核对好航班号⁴，早早去机场办理登记手续⁵。一切都令人兴奋——新的地方、等着我们的汽车旅馆⁶，还有那份自由的心情。

By the second day, I began to have a runny nose⁷ and a light stomachache⁸. My friends worried that it might be some infectious illness⁹, maybe even bird flu¹⁰ or SARS¹¹, but the symptom¹² seemed mild. Still, I sneezed (sneeze¹³) again and again, and my body felt strange. We decided to visit a clinic¹⁴, where a kind physician¹⁵ greeted us.

到第二天，我开始流鼻涕⁷、还有点胃疼⁸。朋友担心是不是得了什么传染病⁹，甚至怀疑是禽流感¹⁰或非典¹¹，不过症状¹²看起来还好。但我一直在打喷嚏¹³，身体很不对劲。于是我们去了诊所¹⁴，一位和蔼的内科医生¹⁵接待了我们。

The attending doctor¹⁶ checked my temperature — I had a temperature¹⁷ and showed signs of an allergy¹⁸. Luckily, nothing serious. In the infirmary¹⁹, a surgeon²⁰ passed by and smiled. The doctor also reminded me to see a dentist soon, since I had dental decay²¹ and a slight toothache²². It seemed like every part of my body wanted attention!

主治医师¹⁶帮我量了体温——我发烧¹⁷了，还有些过敏¹⁸迹象。幸好不严重。在医务室¹⁹里，一位外科医生²⁰经过时还微笑着点头。医生还提醒我该看牙医了，因为我有龋齿²¹，还有点牙疼²²。感觉全身上下都在抗议呢。

After resting a day, I decided to watch my diet²³ and do some physical exercise²⁴. During the trip, I had put on weight²⁵ from all the delicious food. Now, I wanted to lose weight²⁶, so I went on a diet²⁷ and joined a morning yoga class near the resort²⁸. I didn’t want to be overweight²⁹ anymore — I wanted to feel light and free again.

休息了一天后，我决定注意饮食²³、做些锻炼²⁴。旅途中吃太多美食，我已经长胖²⁵了。于是我开始减肥²⁶、节食²⁷，还在度假胜地²⁸附近报了个晨间瑜伽班。我不想再肥胖²⁹，只想重新找回轻盈与自由。

After a week, I felt in good shape³⁰ again — maybe even fit as a fiddle³¹! At first, I had been in poor shape³², feeling under the weather³³, but now I was in a fit state³⁴. My energy returned, and my heart felt open to new adventures. I took a high-speed train³⁵ to the mountains, and later a ferry³⁶ across a quiet lake. I even tried skiing³⁷ for the first time and soaked in a mineral bath³⁸ afterward.

一周后，我又身体健康³⁰了——甚至好得不得了³¹！起初我身体状况不佳³²，总是觉得不舒服³³，但现在又恢复到了健康状态³⁴。精力回来了，心也重新向世界敞开。我坐上高铁³⁵去了山里，又搭上渡船³⁶穿过静静的湖面。第一次体验了滑雪³⁷，然后泡在矿泉浴³⁸里，真是幸福。

At the end of my journey, I returned by express train³⁹, holding a roundtrip⁴⁰ ticket. The trip taught me more than I expected — about health, balance, and joy. Even when feeling out of shape⁴¹, I learned that rest and care could bring me back to life, ready for the next expressway⁴² of dreams.

旅程的最后，我拿着往返旅行⁴⁰的票，乘特快列车³⁹回家。这趟旅行让我学到很多——关于健康、平衡与快乐。即使曾经身体不好⁴¹，只要好好休息和照顾自己，就能重新振作，迎向人生新的高速公路⁴²。
