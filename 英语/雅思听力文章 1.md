📖 A Day in the University Library

It was a quiet afternoon when I walked into the library (图书馆). Rows of shelves¹ stood neatly, filled with countless books. The librarian² smiled and pointed me toward the stacks³, where old volumes rested in silence. I came to return⁴ two books that had been overdue⁸, and luckily, the fine⁵ wasn’t too high.

那是一个安静的午后，我走进了图书馆。一排排书架¹整齐排列，堆满了无数书籍。图书管理员²微笑着指向书库³，那儿安静地躺着旧书。我是来归还⁴两本过期未还的⁸书，好在罚款⁵并不高。

After that, I went to the reading room⁹ and later visited the reference room¹⁰ for my research. Near the periodical room¹¹, I found a cozy study lounge¹², where students were whispering softly. I opened the catalogue¹³ and checked the index¹⁴, typing the keyword¹⁵ of my topic. Soon, I found the right volume¹⁶ I needed.

接着，我去了阅览室⁹，然后又去了资料库¹⁰查资料。在期刊阅览室¹¹附近，我找到一个安静的自习室¹²，学生们轻声讨论着。我翻开书目¹³，查看索引¹⁴，输入了研究主题的关键词¹⁵。很快，我找到了需要的那一卷¹⁶。

I took out my library card¹⁷ to make a book reservation¹⁸, hoping to read some periodicals¹⁹. There were quarterlies²⁰, back issues²¹, and current issues²² stacked on a small table. I even found the latest number²³ of my favorite science magazine. Since photocopying wasn’t allowed without writing permission²⁴, I used the copier⁷ for the pages I was permitted to duplicate.

我拿出借书卡¹⁷做了一个图书预定¹⁸，想阅读一些期刊¹⁹。桌上整齐摆放着季刊²⁰、过刊²¹和现刊²²。我还发现了自己最喜欢的科学杂志的最新一期²³。由于没有书面许可²⁴不能随意复印，我只在允许的部分用了复印机⁷。

Before leaving, I decided to check out²⁵ a few books. Some materials were put on reserve²⁶, meaning they could only be read inside the library. I smiled, thinking how lucky I was to be a student surrounded by so much knowledge.

离开前，我决定外借²⁵几本书。不过有些资料被限制在馆内阅读²⁶，只能在图书馆里看。我微笑着，感叹自己作为一名学生能被知识包围是多么幸运。

🎓 Life as a Student

When I was a freshman¹, everything felt new. As a sophomore² and junior student³, I started focusing on my major. Now, as a senior student⁴, I’m preparing for graduation, hoping to become a bachelor⁵ and maybe pursue a master⁶ or even become a doctoral candidate⁷ someday. I also met many alumni⁸, including one post doctorate⁹ who inspired me deeply.

刚上大学时，我是一名大一学生¹，一切都新鲜。后来成为大二学生²和大三学生³，我开始专注于专业学习。现在是大四学生⁴，正在准备毕业，希望能获得学士⁵学位，将来继续读硕士⁶甚至博士研究生⁷。我还认识了不少校友⁸，其中一位博士后⁹给了我极大启发。

👩‍🏫 Teachers and Courses

Our lecturer¹ and associate professor² are kind and patient, while my supervisor³, who is also a professor⁴, always encourages us to explore. The dean⁵ often checks our progress, and the teaching assistant⁶ helps us with lab reports.

我们的讲师¹和副教授²都很亲切耐心，而我的导师³同时也是一位教授⁴，总是鼓励我们探索。系主任⁵经常来了解我们的进度，助教⁶也会帮忙批改实验报告。

This semester, I decided to take the course¹ “Psychology Course¹⁵” and “Computer Science¹⁸”. I earned three credits² for each and had to register³ early. I almost dropped the course⁴ because it was hard, but I stayed. The introductory course⁵ helped a lot before I moved to the advanced course⁶.

这学期我选了课程¹《心理学课程¹⁵》和《计算机科学¹⁸》。每门课都有三学分²，我一开始就去注册³。中途差点退课⁴，但最终坚持了下来。先修的初级课程⁵帮了大忙，让我顺利进入高级课程⁶。

Our rank⁷ depends on the syllabus⁸ and curriculum⁹ we follow. I also attended a seminar¹⁰ about mental health. Some classes are elective¹¹, while others are compulsory¹². One friend became a drop-out¹³, but I promised myself to stay strong and even passed the makeup exam¹⁴ last term.

我们的排名⁷取决于遵循的教学大纲⁸和课程体系⁹。我还参加了一个关于心理健康的讨论会¹⁰。有的课程是选修课¹¹，有的是必修课¹²。一个朋友退学¹³了，但我告诉自己要坚持，上学期还通过了补考¹⁴。

🌸 Every day, between the library’s quiet air and the classroom’s gentle chatter, I feel the rhythm of learning — soft, endless, like the pages of a book turning toward tomorrow.

🌸 每一天，在图书馆的静谧与课堂的低语之间，我都能感受到学习的节奏——柔和、绵长，如同书页轻轻翻向明天。
