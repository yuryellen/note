Education is not only about gaining credit¹ but also about shaping ethical² values. From the early years in a nursery³, through primary-level education⁴, secondary-level education⁵, and later tertiary-level education⁶, students follow a carefully designed syllabus⁷ or curriculum⁸. These stages ensure that compulsory education⁹ covers compulsory subjects¹⁰ and provides both theoretical knowledge¹¹ and employable skills¹².

教育不仅仅是获得学分¹，更是塑造道德²价值。从在托儿所³开始，到小学教育⁴、中学教育⁵，最后进入大学教育⁶，学生们都要遵循精心设计的课程大纲⁷或课程⁸。这些阶段确保义务教育⁹涵盖必修课程¹⁰，同时提供理论知识¹¹和就业技能¹²。

At school, discipline¹³ is important, and teachers play a leading¹⁴ role. They lead¹⁵, direct¹⁶, and conduct¹⁷ activities, trying to edify¹⁸ and enlighten¹⁹ their students. Some teachers may instruct²⁰ firmly, while others prefer to instil²¹ values gently. In some cases, they initiate²² discussions, or even deliver a sermon²³ when necessary. A good teacher can *motivate the students to do sth.*²⁴ and give the students inspiration²⁵.

在学校里，学科纪律¹³很重要，老师们起着指导¹⁴的作用。他们会引导¹⁵、指导¹⁶、带领¹⁷活动，努力陶冶¹⁸并启发¹⁹学生。有的老师严格教导²⁰，有的则更喜欢温和地灌输²¹价值观。有时，他们会启蒙²²讨论，甚至在必要时进行说教²³。一位好老师能够鼓励学生做事²⁴，并给予学生灵感²⁵。

In boarding nurseries²⁶ or breeding nurseries²⁷, children are taught self-discipline²⁸ and a sense of obligation²⁹. Later, when they face adverse circumstances³⁰, they will not just be following … blindly³¹ but acting with team spirit³² and psychological soundness³³. Education in sciences³⁴, humanities³⁵, social sciences³⁶, liberal studies³⁷, basic sciences³⁸, and applied sciences³⁹ prepares them for different paths, whether through vocational education⁴⁰ or advanced studies.

在全托幼儿所²⁶或育儿托儿所²⁷里，孩子们会被教导自律²⁸与责任感²⁹。这样，当他们以后面对逆境³⁰时，就不会只是盲从³¹，而是能够展现团队精神³²和心理健康³³。科学³⁴、人文学科³⁵、社会科学³⁶、自由学科³⁷、基础科学³⁸与应用科学³⁹的学习，会为他们未来的不同道路做好准备，无论是职业教育⁴⁰还是继续深造。

Throughout history, anthropologists⁴¹, psychologists⁴², and other intellectuals with strong intelligence⁴³ and intellectual⁴⁴ abilities have contributed to our understanding of education. The principal⁴⁵ of a school is not only a leader but also an orator⁴⁶ who inspires. Students may start as apprentices⁴⁷ and eventually earn a bachelor⁴⁸ degree. However, some may remain illiterate⁴⁹ or feel inferior⁵⁰ in their juvenile⁵¹ years, which makes extra-curricular activities⁵² and chances to learn things through understanding⁵³ all the more valuable.

纵观历史，人类学家⁴¹、心理学家⁴²和其他具备高智力⁴³和智力型⁴⁴能力的人，推动了我们对教育的理解。学校的校长⁴⁵不仅是领导者，也是鼓舞人心的演讲者⁴⁶。学生可能一开始是学徒⁴⁷，最后拿到学士⁴⁸学位。然而，有些人可能仍是文盲⁴⁹，或在青少年⁵¹时期感到自卑⁵⁰，这时课外活动⁵²和在理解基础上的学习⁵³就显得尤为珍贵。

Finally, whether in an audition⁵⁴, a classroom, or public life, people are judged not only by their ethical standards⁵⁵ but also by how education has shaped them. True success comes when knowledge, values, and character merge into one.

最后，无论是在试听⁵⁴、课堂还是公共生活中，人们被评判的标准不仅是他们的道德规范⁵⁵，更是教育如何塑造了他们。真正的成功，是当知识、价值与人格融为一体之时。
