Paragraph 1
 A Day in the City’s Traffic
This morning, I had to reverse¹ my car out of the garage before joining the busy street. Soon, I tried to overtake² a slow vehicle, but suddenly the road was wet and my car began to skid³. Luckily, the suspension⁴ system absorbed the shock, and the good traction⁵ of my tires helped me control the car again. Through the windscreen⁶, I saw the traffic police signaling vehicles to accelerate⁷ or brake⁸ depending on the situation. At one point, I had to decelerate⁹ and finally park¹⁰ near a shop.

 今早，我得把车从车库里倒出来¹，然后开上繁忙的街道。很快，我尝试超车²，超过一辆慢吞吞的车，但突然路面湿滑，我的车开始打滑³。幸运的是，悬挂系统⁴吸收了冲击力，而轮胎良好的抓地力⁵帮我重新控制住了车辆。透过挡风玻璃⁶，我看见交警在示意车辆根据情况加速⁷或刹车⁸。有一刻，我不得不减速⁹，最后把车停¹⁰在一家商店旁边。

Paragraph 2
Using my bearing¹¹, I found a safe route along the guardrail¹² of the highway¹³, and then turned at a T-junction¹⁴. On the way, I saw many pedestrians¹⁵ walking on the pavement¹⁶, and the traffic was heavy at the intersection¹⁷. A motorcycle¹⁸, a coach¹⁹, and an express²⁰ train nearby all added to the noise, while a helicopter²¹ flew overhead. Even an electromobile²² passed by quietly. I noticed a cyclist²³ and a motorcyclist²⁴ weaving through the cars.

 借助我的方向感¹¹，我沿着高速公路¹³的护栏¹²找到了一条安全路线，然后在一个丁字路口¹⁴转弯。一路上，我看见许多行人¹⁵走在人行道¹⁶上，而在十字路口¹⁷交通十分拥堵。一辆摩托车¹⁸、一辆长途客车¹⁹和一列特快²⁰火车同时制造着噪音，头顶还有一架直升机²¹飞过。甚至还有一辆电动车²²安静地驶过。我注意到有骑自行车的人²³和骑摩托的人²⁴在人群车流中穿梭。

Paragraph 3
The government now promotes energy-saving²⁵ vehicles, and the modernisation²⁶ of the city has created new roads. But still, some areas become a bottleneck²⁷, and the streets are overcrowded²⁸ with cars. Sometimes a traffic violator²⁹ makes things worse, but when all cars start up³⁰ again after a jam, everyone rushes to the limit of the speed limit³¹. Drivers are reminded to follow the highway code³², obey each traffic sign³³, and to change gear³⁴ smoothly. Still, some drivers push to their top speed³⁵ or forget to switch off the motor³⁶ when waiting.

 现在，政府提倡节能²⁵型车辆，而城市的现代化²⁶建设也带来了新道路。但依然有些区域成为瓶颈²⁷，街道上挤满²⁸了汽车。有时候，一个交通违规者²⁹会让情况更糟，但当堵车后所有车辆重新启动³⁰时，大家又争相冲到限速³¹的边缘。司机们被提醒要遵守公路法典³²，遵守每一个交通标志³³，并且要平稳地换挡³⁴。不过，仍然有些司机拼命开到最高时速³⁵，或在等待时忘记熄火³⁶。

Paragraph 4
The city also has pedestrians street³⁷ areas where no cars are allowed, and different lanes such as the inside lane³⁸, outside lane³⁹, single carriageway⁴⁰, and even a ring road⁴¹. On the overtaking lane⁴², cars rush quickly, while workers repair a makeshift road⁴³. Some roads are modern tarred roads⁴⁴, and others include an elevated highroad⁴⁵ or a dual carriageway⁴⁶.

 城市里还有步行街³⁷区域，禁止汽车进入，并且划分了不同的车道，比如内车道³⁸、外车道³⁹、单行车道⁴⁰，甚至还有环城公路⁴¹。在超车道⁴²上，汽车飞驰而过，而工人们正在修补临时道路⁴³。有的路是现代化的柏油路⁴⁴，有的则包括高架道路⁴⁵或双向车道⁴⁶。

Paragraph 5
Reports say that the number of car ownership⁴⁷ has been rising every year. Luckily, scientists are working on pollution-free fuel⁴⁸ to reduce emissions. Citizens must observe traffic regulations⁴⁹ and never break traffic regulations⁵⁰. Otherwise, they may get struck in traffic⁵¹ for hours, especially because the road networks⁵² are extremely busy during rush hour⁵³. To ease the traffic pressure⁵⁴, city planners are introducing better public transport.

 据报道，汽车保有量⁴⁷每年都在增加。幸运的是，科学家正在研究无污染燃料⁴⁸来减少排放。市民必须遵守交通规则⁴⁹，绝不能违反交通规则⁵⁰。否则，他们可能会被堵在路上⁵¹好几个小时，特别是在高峰时段⁵³，因为道路网络⁵²极其繁忙。为了缓解交通压力⁵⁴，城市规划者正在引入更好的公共交通。

Paragraph 6
Meanwhile, experts warn that chronic lead poisoning⁵⁵ once caused by old fuels is a serious danger. That is why the automobile industry⁵⁶ is moving toward cleaner, greener, and safer solutions for everyone.

 与此同时，专家警告说，旧式燃料曾引发的慢性铅中毒⁵⁵是一个严重的危险。这就是为什么汽车工业⁵⁶正在转向更加清洁、绿色和安全的解决方案，为所有人谋福利。
